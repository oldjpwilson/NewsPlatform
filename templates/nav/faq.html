            <p class="row text-justify"> <br> Here you will find some of the most popular questions about NewsPlatform, the platform for journalists and public who believe that News should be a profitable business, but not be funded by advertising. The only two parties involved should
                be journalists doing the reporting (earning) and the public who do the consuming (paying). 'Third parties' - usually advertisers, should not have any say in this process, as their motives are not aligned with the public who require the
                news. We want to make your experience as smooth as possible; should you not find an answer on this page, please <a href="{% url 'contact' %}"> contact </a> &nbsp; us for immediate assistance.

                    <li>Users may create as many channels, and publish as many articles as they wish. Keep in mind that people will only pay for high quality, valuable articles.</li>

            <h4 class="justify-content-center">How to subscribe & how much it costs ($0.50 / channel / month)</h4>
            <p class="row text-justify">
                NewsPlatform aims to allow journalists to write high quality content without the burden of requiring very large numbers of readers to 'drive traffic' to the site and earn income via ad-revenue. <br> For consumers of news, NewsPlatform
                allows them to subscribe to niche channels at a fee of USD 0.50 per channel per month for an ad-free News Service. The benefits for consumers include:
                <ul>
                    <li>Never being bombarded by clickbait 'news' articles.</li>
                    <li>No more news sites filled with auto-play ad videos and irrelevent ads obscuring the news content.</li>
                    <li>Refined, affordable news service. Only pay for the news that you want, from journalists you trust.</li>
                    <li>No more being locked into a provider. If your interests change, or a channel's quality drops, simply unsubscribe. </li>
                    <li>To illustrate, for USD $8.00 per month, a user could subscribe to 16 diverse channels, each a specialist in their niche area, from a global finance news channel, to a neighbourhood community news bulletin, to news on a niche sport
                        in a niche location.</li>
                </ul>
                High quality, diverse, ad-free news is no longer elusive. Free News is not News.... It's advertising. Free News also means that the reader is not the customer, they are the product, being sold to the advertizers.
